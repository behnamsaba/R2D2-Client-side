## Overview

The R2D2 client-side prototype utilizes React and React Router for client-side rendering. The app interacts with a Flask backend that communicates with the OpenAI API using Langchain. R2D2 employs Tailwind CSS for its UI and Redux Toolkit to store market research data in the store. Similar to a Google Chrome extension, R2D2 has the ability to personalize emails and offers CRM features along with marketing features. It's important to note that this project only covers a small portion of the actual R2D2 Google extension.
